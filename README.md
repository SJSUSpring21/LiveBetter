Project Ideas:
-------------

Healthy Eating Buddy
--------------------
Give the application some parameters like budget, dietary restrictions, likes and dislikes.
The app will come up with a diet plan for that day/week.
Diet plan will be a recipe, so the user can make a home cooked meal.

House Scoring Project
---------------------
We can build an application to calculate the liveability index for houses.
Livability Index can be calculated based on the locality and amenities available   (gym,school,hospital etc)
This in turn can then help people make informed choices while buying or renting homes

My Lawyer
---------
An application which helps read and understand the nuances of any legal documents (or terms and conditions while signing up/lease agreements etc)
And summarize the details or any important points that must be read by the user before signing.
