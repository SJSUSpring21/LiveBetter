House Scoring Project
---------------------

**Introduction**

We can build an application to calculate the liveability index for houses.
Livability Index can be calculated based on the locality and amenities available   (gym,school,hospital etc)
This in turn can then help people make informed choices while buying or renting homes

**Abstract**

The motivation of this project is to help home buyers or renters make an informed decision before they
choose a place to live. There are many factors that play into deciding where to live. A given location 
should fit a persons needs and lifestyle. The goal of this project is to consider common factors that
contribute to a person's decision on whether to move to a new place. 

**Approach**

Input: What information are we going to get from the user? 
> Possibly an address, or neighborhood

Process:
> We are going to analyze various aspects of a location. 
> Some possibilities to consider: Schools, gyms, hospitals, supermarkets, outdoor recreation

Output: What will the output be for our users?
> Possibly a 1 - 10 score of "livability"
> A brief description of services nearby: "This location has 3 schools within 2 miles. 1 gym within 1 mile."

**Persona**

Our target audience will be individuals looking to buy or rent a home/apartment. This will help
users make an informed decision.
